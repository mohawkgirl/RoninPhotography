# CityDawg & Crew - GitHub Pages Instructions

This folder contains:
- index.html (your portfolio homepage)
- Placeholder image files (replace with your real images)
- README.md (these instructions)

## ✅ How to Publish This on GitHub Pages

1. Go to https://github.com and create a free account if you don't have one.
2. Click the "+" icon at the top right > "New repository".
3. Name your repository something like `citydawg-portfolio`. Leave it Public. Do NOT initialize with a README.
4. After creating the repo, click "Add file" > "Upload files".
5. Upload **all the files in this ZIP** (including the index.html and placeholder images).
6. Click "Commit changes" at the bottom.

## 🌍 Enable GitHub Pages

1. Click the "Settings" tab in your new repo.
2. In the left sidebar, scroll to "Pages".
3. Under "Source", choose:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4. Click "Save".

GitHub will give you a live link like:  
`https://yourusername.github.io/citydawg-portfolio/`

This may take 30–60 seconds to go live.

You can then edit the `index.html` file directly on GitHub or replace the placeholders with your real photos by uploading them one at a time.

Happy publishing! 🐾
